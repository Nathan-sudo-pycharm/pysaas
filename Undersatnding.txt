deploying django to railway with docker containers

gunicorn: is a Python Web Server Gateway Interface HTTP server
reason for adding railway.toml : if u need to have other docer files. u can declare them in railway.toml file
dockerfilePath = "./Dockerfile" : u can add the other docker file here . Example if your docker file name is V2. then the line will be : " dockerfilePath = "./Dockerfile.V2"  "

line : 
watchPatterns = [
    "requirements.txt", 
    "src/**", 
    "railway.toml",
    "Dockerfile",
]

states tht the docker must watch for those files , if there are changes in those files then " BUILD " the file/folder again.
